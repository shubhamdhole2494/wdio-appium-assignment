##Mobile Test Automation using Appium, webdriverio, typescript, Mocha

#Tech stack :

1. Appium - This is the node server which interacts with the mobile devices.
2. WebdriverIO - It is the selenium webdriver api bindings for node.js, It has a very simple api which could be used to automate web & browser apps in a fast and scalable way.
3. Typescript (Javascript) - It is the superset of javascript which has additional static typings and features like JAVA and other languaes. Now you could write your code which compiles to pure javascript.
4. Mocha: Mocha.js is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework that is widely used for testing JavaScript codes. It can run on both Node. js and in the browser, making it a versatile.

##Getting Started
#Pre-requisites
1.NodeJS installed globally in the system. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2.JAVA (jdk) installed in the system.

4.Set JAVA_HOME & ANDROID_HOME paths correctly in the system.
5.Chrome browser installed.
6. Text Editor/IDE (Optional) installed--â€ºSublime/Visual Studio Code/Brackets.

Tip: Install npm install -g appium-doctor and run it from the command-line which checks, if your java jok and android sk paths are set correctly or not.


##Installation
##Setup Scripts

1. Clone the repository into a folder
2. Go inside the folder and run following command from terminal/command
Command to install node modules: npm install
3. All the dependencies from package. json and typescript typings would be installed in node_modules folder.


##Command to run tests :
1. To run local android test : "npm run android:test"
2. To run local ios test: " npm run ios:test"
3. To run local ios test: " npm run report"
